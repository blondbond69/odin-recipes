So, I'm trying to do my first, really simple webpage using HTML and following instructions from The Odin Project
I had a troubles with SSH (I hope this was a problem with SSH) but I deald with it using ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa and now I don't need to write my PIN everytime 
Now I'm trying to remind myself how to work with GIT 

Ok, it's done!
It went rather neatly and without any major problems
Of course I forgot to use git commands during progress and I did it at very end of the work - So, I don't have any comments during work
